For example, I am studying violence related to competition between armed groups and illicit economies in Colombia. Using data available about the number of armed groups in a region and the amount of illicit goods, a political scientist could predict where violence might happen next and prevent it. They could also assess the success of public policy interventions in violence rates. These are things that really inspire me because I believe data can inform policy and therefore make for better policy._",
